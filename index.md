<p>Legos have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.
One of the first few memories I remeber is buying a Lego City firetruck. 
I remember begging my parents, who were showing one of their friends around town, to take me home so I can build the fire truck. 
Lego has been a big part of my life. I even have a video on my dad's youtube channel of my copying EvanTubeHD.
No, I will not link to that video. This is a very small tribute to a big part of my childhood.</p>

<p> All I can say is watch this video. It does a far better job of explaining the history of Lego than I ever could. I will also include a video on how the bricks themselves are actually made. That video is below.</p>

<p> due to Legoâ€™s lack of "care" sometimes the community has made some custom sets of their own. People are even starting bussinesses to sell the instructions and peieces. However be warned these sets do not go through the rigorous testing that normal lego sets do. Also the parts that you can buy can be used.
